# EDA-on-IMDB-Movies-Dataset

Senario: I am a data scientist in a Movie Production Company and they tasked me with an Exploratory Data Analysis on an IMDB dataset with movies. The goal is to search for trends and characteristics of movies that made them popular in order to take them as an inspiration for developing a whole new movie in our Production Company.
